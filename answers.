(1).a True
(1).b False

2.When applying an operation to two vectors that requires them to be the same length, 
R automatically recycles, or repeats, the shorter one, until it is long enough to match the longer one.

3.Example of recycling of elements:
Suppose we have two Vectors c(1,2,4) , c(6,0,9,10,13), where the first one is shorter with only 3 elements. Now if we sum these two, we will get a warning message as follows.
> c(1,2,4) + c(6,0,9,10,13)
[1]  7  2 13 11 15
Warning message:
In c(1, 2, 4) + c(6, 0, 9, 10, 13) :  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length

Here R , Sum those Vectors by Recycling or repeating the elements in shorter one, until it is long enough to match the longer one as 
follows..

> c(1,2,4,1,2) + c(6,0,9,10,13)
[1]  7  2 13 11 15
